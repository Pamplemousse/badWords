# badWords

This is a plugin to highlight unwanted words for educational writing.

It all started with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jesstelford/status/992757640315858946).


## Install

If you don't have a preferred installation method, you could use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), and then add `Bundle 'pamplemousse/badWords'` in your `.vimrc` file.

At last, `:PluginInstall` in Vim and you are done!
